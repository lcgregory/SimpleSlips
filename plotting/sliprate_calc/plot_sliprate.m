%%Slip rate and slip rate variability calculator
%
% Use this code to plot the output from TC's slip rate calculator in 
% python (slips.py). 
%
% **This script needs some work!**
%
% The format for TC's code inserts 1 cm of slip at time = 0 and 1 cm of
% slip at time = scarp age. This allows for an effective rate to be
% calculated between the last earthquake and the modern day (and the
% oldest/second oldest event). This 'effective rate' would change if there
% was an earthquake tomorrow. You can change this by setting 'today' and
% 'startslip' to = 0.
%
% You can calculate the slip rate (as a pdf) for a given time in the
% model - e.g. for the average slip rate between 2 assigned slip numbers,
% for the average sliprate between the current day and a slip number, or
% for the average slip rate of the entired distribution (e.g. from today
% until the last slip). 
%
% The rate will be plotted as a pdf, which represents the distribution of
% rate calculated for the given slip number.

%% Parameters 

%Fault name
faultname = 'Caporciano';

%set the burnin to remove the initial modelling phase before models settle
burnin = 40000;

%set the part of the distribution you would like to plot, e.g. for the top 
%1000 most likely slip histories, pick 1000. For the full distribution, 
%write th number of models minus the burnin (e.g. 200k - 40k - write 160k)
age_distribution = 10000;

%set file names

sliphistoryfile = '../../sliphistory.out';
%output from TC's python script
ratesfile = 'output_slip_averagesCAP.dat';

%set slip number for calculation. This counts back from the most recent
%event (which is slipno = 1), the penultimate event is slipno = 2, etc. The
%code will also output the average slip rate for the entire distribution,
%calculated by dividing the scarp age by the height of the scarp.

slipno = 6;
slipno2 = 5;

% set slip at 'today' and at the 'start' (e.g. oldest) to calculate an
% effective slip rate in TC's code for the start and end of your
% sliphistories.

today = 1;
